        "longDescription": "HarmonE is an architectural approach that helps machine learning pipelines adapt on their own. It monitors accuracy, energy use, and data changes to keep things running smoothly. It only takes action when needed, based on sustainability goals set in advance. HarmonE uses a MAPE-K loop (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) to drive adaptation and has been tested on city traffic systems, showing 54.5% less energy usage than traditional retraining approaches while achieving 95% of the best model's accuracy.",
